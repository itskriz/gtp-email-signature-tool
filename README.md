## Outlook 2016
Installing these signatures for Outlook 2016 is a bit more complicated.
1. Go to Outlook Options > Mail and click "Signatures"
2. Create a new signature. Name it somethin simple like "My GTP Signature" and save your changes (it will be empty)
3. Again, at the Outlook Options > Mail page, click "Signatures" again, this time pressing and holding the Control key as you do so. This should open a new window
4. In this new window, find and delete the **.htm** file named after the signature you just created (ie: My GTP Signature.htm)
5. Copy the **.htm** file you download to the new window. Once complete, rename the file exactly as you named your signature (ie: My STP Signature.htm)
6. Back in Outlook, you signature may look strange in the signature settings. That's okay. Just draft a new email and test your signature to ensure it looks correct.
